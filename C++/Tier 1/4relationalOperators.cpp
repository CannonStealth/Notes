/*Relational Operators
When writing conditional statements, sometimes we need to use different types of operators to compare values. These operators are called relational operators.

To have a condition, we need relational operators:

== equal to
!= not equal to
> greater than
< less than
>= greater than or equal to
<= less than or equal to

5 != 4 true
4 < 8 true
3 > 5 false
8 <= 8 true
