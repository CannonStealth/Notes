/*If our program has no compile-time errors and no link-time errors, it’ll run. This is where the fun really starts.

Errors which happen during program execution (run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. Run-time errors occur when a program with no compile-time errors and link-time errors asks the computer to do something that the computer is unable to reliably do.

It happens after we give the ./ execute command:

./a.exe
Some common run-time errors:

Division by zero also known as division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesn’t point to the line at which the error occurs.
