/*
When we are writing C++ programs, the compiler is our first line of defense against errors.

There are two types of compile-time errors:

Syntax errors: Errors that occur when we violate the rules of C++ syntax.
Type errors: Errors that occur when there are mismatch between the types we declared.
Some common syntax errors are:

Missing semicolon (;)
Missing closing parenthesis ), square bracket ], or curly brace }
Some common type errors are:

Forgetting to declare a variable
Storing a value into the wrong type
