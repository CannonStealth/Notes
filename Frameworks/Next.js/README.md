<h1 align="center">Next.js â€“ React Framework by Vercel</h1>

<p align="center">
  Next.js is a React framework maintained by Vercel. 
  It is has built-in support for client-side routing, server side rendering, static site generation, image optimization, and loads more features.
  Documentation can be found <a href="https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started">here</a>, and when you're done with your Next.js app, you can always deploy it to <a href="http://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.
</p>

## Getting Started

To bootstrap a new Next.js app, use `create-next-app` using either NPX or Yarn:

```bash
$ npx create-next-app my-project
```

```bash
$ yarn create next-app my-project
```

This will create a new Next.js app in a directory named `my-project`. 
If the directory is not empty, make sure to empty it first.

If you want to create the app in the current folder, use `.` as the name instead.

Go ahead `cd` into the new project and run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start the app.
