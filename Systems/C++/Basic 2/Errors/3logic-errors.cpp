/*Once we have removed the compile-time errors, link-time errors, and run-time errors, the program runs successfully. But sometimes, the program doesn’t do what we want it to do or no output is produced. Hmmm…

These types of errors which provide incorrect output, but appears to be error-free, are called logical errors. These are one of the most common errors that happen to beginners and also usually the most difficult to find and eliminate.

Logical errors solely depend on the logical thinking of the programmer. Your job now is to figure out why the program didn’t do what you wanted it to do.

Some common logic errors:

Program logic is flawed
Some “silly” mistake in an if statement or a for/while loop
Note: Logic errors don’t have error messages. Sometimes, programmers use a process called test-driven development (TDD), a way to give logic errors error messages and save yourself a lot of headaches!*/
