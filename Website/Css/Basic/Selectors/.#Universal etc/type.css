p {
     /* 
     The element type is p, which comes from the HTML <p> tag.
     Useful notes on the type selector:
     The type selector does not include the angle brackets.
     Since element types are often referred to by their opening tag name,
     the type selector is sometimes referred to as the tag name or element selector. */
